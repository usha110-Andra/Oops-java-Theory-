Method Overloading
Definition: When two or more methods in the 
same class (or parent & child) have the same
name but different parameter lists.
Achieved at compile-time → that’s why
it’s called compile-time polymorphism.

Difference can be in:
Number of parameters
Type of parameters
Order of parameters

Rules of Overloading

Methods must have different parameter lists (number, type, or order).
Return type alone cannot differentiate overloaded methods.
Can occur in the same class or between parent-child classes.
Can also overload constructors.

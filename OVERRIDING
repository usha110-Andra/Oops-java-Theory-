Method Overriding
Definition: When a subclass (child class) 
provides its own implementation of a method
that is already defined in the superclass 
(parent class).The method name, return type,
and parameters must be the same.
Achieved at runtime → it is the main w
ay to implement run-time polymorphism.

Rules of Method Overriding :

Method must have the same signature (name + parameters) as in the parent class.
Return type must be the same or covariant (a subclass of the parent return type).
Access level cannot be more restrictive (e.g., if parent method is public, child can’t make it private).
@Override annotation is recommended to avoid mistakes.
Static, final, and private methods cannot be overridden.

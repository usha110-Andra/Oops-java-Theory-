Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

It occurs when the method that gets executed
is determined at runtime, not at compile-time.
Achieved through method overriding â†’ a child
class provides its own version of a method
already defined in the parent class.
The object type decides which method runs.
It uses the concept of dynamic method dispatch.

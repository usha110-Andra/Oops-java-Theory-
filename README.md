Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism) :

The method that will run is decided
during compilation.
Achieved through method overloading 
(same method name, different parameter list).
The compiler checks the arguments
passed and picks the correct method.
It is faster since thereâ€™s no runtime decision-making.
